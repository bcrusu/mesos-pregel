## mesos-pregel: A distributed graph processing framework

### Usage

todo

### Items left to do:

- [ ] More testing
- [ ] Complete checkpointing mechanism (during superstep execution and beforee a new superstep is started)
- [ ] Aggregators type conversion (e.g. SumInt/MaxInt/MinInt aggregators should accept all integer data types, not only int64)
- [ ] Cassandra replication strategies (atm. the keyspace replication strategy is ignored - see "replicationStrategy.go")
- [ ] Better task scheduling logic (e.g. keep track of past performance and failures for each slave node)
- [ ] ...
